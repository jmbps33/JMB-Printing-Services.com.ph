# JMB Printing Services - High Quality Prints

This project is a static website for **JMB Printing Services**, showcasing services, gallery, and company profile.

## Files

- `JMBPS23.htm` → Main HTML structure of the website (keeps inline styles).
- `style.css` → Extracted global CSS from `<style>` tags.
- `script.js` → Extracted JavaScript functionality from `<script>` tags.
- `README.md` → Documentation.

## Usage

1. Open `JMBPS23.htm` in a browser.
2. Make sure `style.css` and `script.js` are in the same directory.
3. Customize `style.css` for design changes.
4. Update `script.js` for interactivity.

## Notes

- Inline styles inside the HTML remain untouched.
- Only embedded `<style>` and `<script>` blocks were moved out into external files.
